Shell Tips and Tricks

Adam, @abatten: `cd -`
Using `cd -` will take you back to the last directory you were in.
This is good for changing between two directories.

Renee, @respiewak: `grep -A NUM`
If you're interested in a few lines of a file _following_ a particular
keyword, using `grep -A NUM` is your best bet. The opposite is
`grep -B NUM`, to show lines before the matching line. 

Daniel, @DBerke: `find`
`find` is a really powerful command that can replicate or replace the 
functionality of several other commands such as ls, grep, or rm. The problem
is that it's SO powerful that it's not easy to use at first due to all the
options. Just a few really helpful ones:

-type [d,f]
    Follow this with a `d` for directory or `f` for file. Allows you to filter
    out what you want find to search for.
-maxdepth, -mindepth n
    This tells find how many directories deep to search. You can easily limit
    it to looking only in the current directory, or to search everything below
    the current directory, or only in directories exactly two deep.
-delete
    Powerful. *Extremely* dangerous. But also useful. Ever tried to delete a few
    thousand files with rm and have it fail because the argument list is too
    long? `find . * -delete` will delete everything in the current folder, no
    matter how many there are.
-exec utility {} [;|+]
    A rather interesting alternative to using a pipe, this will execute a
    given program on each object returned by find. Must be terminated by
    either a semicolon (which operates on each path-name individually) or a plus
    sign (with gives the program as many path-names as it can handle at each
    invocation). The '{}' is used to stand in for the path-name(s). ';' may
    need to be escaped in the shell as '\;'.
    Oh yeah, you can use this to chain successive find commands together, too.

Taken together, find can do some extremely powerful things in a single
command.

James, @jamesesdaile: 'cat'
Prints all the text in a file to the terminal (not a word editor).
Can be used with '|' and 'grep' to display a specific portion of the file. 

Also a resource I use a lot, The UNIX Grymoire:

Helpful, understandable tutorials on things like regular expressions, find,
sed, the bash shell, etc.
